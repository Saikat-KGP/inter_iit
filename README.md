Room Booking feature:- after clicking on book rooms users can see an array of rooms , the data of all the rooms including the hotel name , description , price and availability is fetched from the database(MySql here), after clicking on Book Rooms the availability of rooms decreases by 1.....it also shows alerts that room is booked and instructs you to refresh the webpage 

Things Incomplete:-
